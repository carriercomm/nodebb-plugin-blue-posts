# NodeBB Blue Posts

A really simple plugin that checks for the user's group, and if an Admin, will make their post "blue", similar to what they do for administrators on Blizzard forums. If the group is Moderator, their post will be coloured green.

Only compatible with the Lavender theme (or any theme that displays badges).


## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-blue-posts
